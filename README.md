# Intro

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mradamdavies - a.k.a Abeon / Nowares.
I've worked with computers for around 25 years. My first computer was a BBC Micro!

I'm passionate about pentesting and a sardonic security specialist. My code might be potato, but it's mashes spuds lovely :)

Feel free to tell me how bad my code is. I'm a big boy. I promise not to cry!
