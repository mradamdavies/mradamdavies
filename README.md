# Intro

👋 Hi, I’m @mradamdavies - a.k.a Abeon / Nowares.
I've worked with computers for around 25 years. My first computer was a BBC Micro!

I'm a passionate pentester and a sardonic security specialist.

Feel free to tell me how bad my code is. I'm a big boy. I promise not to cry!

If you think you can help us catch scammers, we may be able to work together. Check out my social links below to get in touch. 

FYI; my original GitHub profile is here: https://github.com/Abeon

I go by my real name now, so created this one intead!
